# React Weather App

Demo for DU Coding Boot Camp React Weather App Review Session. This app demos React basics including the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, and also uses `styled-components`, `Reactstrap`, `axios`, and `moment`.

## Getting Started

Run an `npm install` then an `npm start`. For this app to run properly, you will need to create a `.env` file at the root of the project containing two key/val pairs: 
* `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_KEY` (a Google API key with the Geocoding API enabled)
* `REACT_APP_WEATHER_KEY` (a Weatherbit API key).
